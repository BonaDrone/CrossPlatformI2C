This library supports communication with I<sup>2</sup>C devices on today's
popular micrcontroller and single-board-computer platforms:

* Arduino 
* Teensy
* Raspberry Pi
* NVIDIA Jetson 

The project is similar in spirit to Jeff Rowberg's I<sup>2</sup>Cdevlib[https://www.i2cdevlib.com], but unlike
I<sup>2</sup>Cdevlib, CrossPlatformI2C does not provide code for particular I<sup>2</sup> devices.  Instead,
we provide support for such sensors in other repositories, which work together with CrossPlatformI2C to help
you use those sensors.
